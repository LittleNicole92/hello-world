# hello-world
This is the repository I made to learn the way to use GitHub and start a project.
Hi there! My name is Nicole. I'm just starting to learn about data science and software engineering. 
I hope to one day use the skills I learn to work for a Remote Software engineering or Data Editor, as well as any other jobs I can utilize these new skills.
